# What is Compliance and GMP?
The word _compliance_ is often used in the industry by itself, but what is really meant is _compliance with federal regulations_. 
GMP is a term commonly used in the pharma industry. It stands for _Good Manufacturing Practices_ and despite 
the seemingly general wording, GMP a term virtually exclusive to the pharma industry. Words commonly used interchangebly with GMP are:

* cGMP - Current Good Manufacturing Practices.
* GxP - Good x Practices, where x stands for different sub-areas within the industry.
* cGxP - Current Good x Practices.

There are small variations, but the overall meaning is the same - following federal regulations.

## What role does compliance have in pharma?
Pharmaceutical companies - especially those manufacturing drugs for injection - are subject to some of the strictest 
laws across all industries. This is reflected inside the workplaces, by most of the task not directly related to ensuring 
production revolving around ensuring compliance.

pharmaceutical plants are very encompassing. This entails describing most actions through SOPs - Standard Operating Procedures. -->
