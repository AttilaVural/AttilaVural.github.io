# Compliance & its role in pharma



## What is Compliance and _GMP_?
The word _compliance_ is often used in the industry by itself, but what is really meant is _compliance with federal regulations_. 
GMP is a term commonly used in the pharma industry. It stands for _Good Manufacturing Practices_ and despite 
the seemingly general wording, GMP a term virtually exclusive to the pharma industry. Words commonly used interchangebly with GMP are:

* cGMP - Current Good Manufacturing Practices.
* GxP - Good x Practices, where x stands for different sub-areas within the industry.
* cGxP - Current Good x Practices.

There are small variations, but the overall meaning is the same - following federal regulations.

## What does compliance have in pharma?
Pharmaceutical companies - especially those manufacturing drugs for injection - are subject to some of the strictest 
laws across all industries. This is reflected inside the workplaces, by most of the task not directly related to ensuring 
production revolving around ensuring compliance.

### US regulations
The FDA regulatory requirements are seen as the most important laws to comply with, and these are found in 
_FDA CFR, Title 21, Part 11 - Electronic Records & Signatures_.

This [link](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-11) takes you to the full text.


### EU regulations
These are found in _EudraLex (EMA), Volume 4 (GMP), Annex 11 - Computerised Systems_, which is often abbreviated as _EU GMP Annex 11_.

The full text can be found [here](https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2016-11/annex11_01-2011_en_0.pdf), 
and the entire annex only consists of 5 pages.

### Other national agencies
Other countries often look towards the FDA and EU requirements, when forming their own sets of requirements.

Some of the other national pharmaceutical regulatory agencies, 
which companies must adhere to if they wish to operate in these markets, include the Japanese PMDA and the Chinese NMPA.
