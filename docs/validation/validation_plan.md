## Using the Risk Assessment tool for planning validation activities
**Determine relevant IT risk controls to test during validation of an IT system after implenting changes**

1. Determine which of the listed generic IT URS requirement are likely to be impacted by the change.
2. From these URS requirements, selected the corresponding IT risk controls, which have been implemented for the current system, and which might be affected by the planned activities.
3. Use your knowledge of the IT system to formulate the test-steps needed to ensure that these risk controls work as intended.
