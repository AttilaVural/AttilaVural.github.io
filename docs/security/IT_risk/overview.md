<!-- ## Assessing IT risk based standard URS requirements -->
# Motivation

Section 16 in [EU GMP Annex 11](index.md) states that computerized systems must be risk assessed to ensure a stable business process:

_For the availability of computerised systems supporting critical processes, provisions should 
be made to ==ensure continuity== of support for those processes in the event of a system 
breakdown (e.g. a manual or alternative system). The time required to bring the alternative 
arrangements into use should be ==based on risk== and appropriate for a particular system and the 
business process it supports. These arrangements should be adequately documented and tested_

Federal agencies mandates these assessments, as a sudden production stop could mean a drug shortage, thereby endangering lives.

## When to perform a Risk Assessment?
A risk assessment is most usefull in the design phase, as incorporating risk controls is easiests in this stage, 
but risk assessment should also be made on finished systems to address changes and new industry trends.
