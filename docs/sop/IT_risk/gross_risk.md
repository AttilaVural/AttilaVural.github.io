## Assessing Gross Risk
### Defining the system state
Gross risk, also called inherent risk, is the amount of risk present, when risk controls are not accounted for. 
But what features constitute risk controls and what are fundemental aspects of a system? Without drawing the line somewhere, 
one trying to assess gross risk can keep stripping down a system until nothing is left.

The most practical approach, is to define the gross risk of a system, as the 
_current risk level given the existing set of controls rather than the hypothetical notion of an absence of any controls_[^1].
### Assessing the risk
Other than finding security holes, one should assess the risk and consequence of existing risk controls failing.
