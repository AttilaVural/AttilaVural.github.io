# Edit: 2023-01-17 - why would you ever do this, when you can instead just clone any of the jekyll theme repos on github?
You can simply copy paste (clone) all the files from any of the themes found here http://jekyllthemes.org/ into your empty \<username\>.github.io repo, refresh the url https://\<username\>.github.io and it will now show a fully working jekyll site.
  
I choose to clone the default minima theme repo (https://github.com/jekyll/minima). 
  
Now I added all my posts in the \_posts folder.
