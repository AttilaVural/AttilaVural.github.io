# Determine relevant URS requirement validation-tests from implemented IT risk controls
The IT Risk controls document takes the user through the following steps, when assessing thought out system:
1. First section determines the gross risk of a system - the term gross risk is formally to be interpreted as "without any risk controls implemented", but this is confusing many people, because just how functionality should you strip away from the system to arrive at the gross risk? Instead the approach of ... is used ...
2.  Now the URS requirements, general for all IT equipment in the industry, are listed along with appropriate suggested risk controls, which are premade and are therefore plenty to ensure that all possible system types are accounted. The user is then tasked with assessing which of these risk controls are appropriate for ensuring that the system in question satisfy the URS requirements, and commenting on how they are implemented or will be implemented.
3.  Now the net risk is calculated.

1. Can you explain the processes for data changes and how they are authorized by the data owner or process owner?
2. Can you explain the measures in place for data integrity, including any residual risks and any mitigating controls used?
3. How does the system comply with GDPR regulations for data deletion and retention?
4. How are user roles and access rights defined and allocated in the system, and how are they regularly reviewed and updated?
5. Can you explain the measures in place for IT security, including user and password management, network security and segregation, and data protection?
6. Can you explain how the system maintains physical and logical separation of environments such as production, development, test, validation, and sandboxes?
7. Can you explain the process for approval of physical or logical network connections between the infrastructure and third parties by the CISO?
8. Can you describe the network security controls that are in place and how they are managed and maintained?
9. How does the system encrypt data when transmitted over open lines or stored on servers, laptops, desktops and other storage media?
10. How does the system handle the disposal of data-carrying media?
